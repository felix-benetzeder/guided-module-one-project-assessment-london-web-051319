Module One Final Project at Flatiron School, 30 May 2019

Catherine Maritz and Felix Benetzeder
========================
For our final project in Module 1 in the Software Engineering immersive course we want to create an application that allows users to write for books that they have read or read reviews about books they might want to read in the future.







  * How to install your application.
  * How to run your application.
  * How to use your application (commands that can be run).
  * What your program looks like (screenshots).
  * etc.
* Prepare a demo video describing how a user would interact with your working project.
    * The video should:
      * Have an overview of your project. (2 minutes max)
* Prepare a presentation to follow your video. (3 minutes max)
    * Your presentation should:
      * Describe something you struggled to build, and show us how you ultimately implemented it in your code.
      * Discuss 3 things you learned in the process of working on this project.
      * Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
      * Present any code you would like to highlight.
